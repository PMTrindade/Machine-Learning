#Assigment 1 - Logistic Regression, Nearest Neighbors Regression and Naive Bayes Regression

##Pre-Process
Load and process the data
- get_data
- train_test_split - test_size = 0.33; stratification
- n folds = 5 ou 10
- kf = Stratifiedkfold

##Logistic Regression
Build and fine tune Logisitic Regression
- find best C param (training and validation sets) -> graph (must return best)
- Evaluate -> test set

##Nearest Neighbors Regression
Build and fine tune K-NN
- find best k (training and validation sets)
- Evaluate -> Test set

##Naive Bayes
Build and fine tune Naive Bayes
- bandwidth
- Evaluate with test set

##Comparisions
